.SH NAME
hovacui - pdf viewer with autozoom to text for X11 and the Linux framebuffer

.
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBhovacui\fP
[\fIoptions\fP]
\fIfile.pdf\fP

.
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION

Viewer for pdf files in X11 and the Linux framebuffer based on poppler,
with autozooming to the blocks of text in the page.

The other pdf viewers require the user to set the zoom explicitly and then to
move the page on the screen via scrollbars or cursor keys. The only automatic
zoom modes available are those fitting the page width or height (or both) to
the screen's.

The \fBhovacui\fP pdf viewer automatically zooms to the blocks of text in the
page. The user only needs to scroll down to continue reading.

This is handy on small screens, especially for documents with small letters.
White margins are not shown and the text is zoomed enough to fit the width of
the screen. Contrary to normal pdf viewer, it is not the page that fits the
width the screen, only the text in it. This means that the letters are larger
and therefore more readable.

Moving through the text for reading is much improved for two-column documents,
or document with multiple columns. A regular pdf viewer requires the user to
first zoom enough to make the letters readable, and then to move across the
page following the text:

.nf
        +-------+     +-------+
        |    <-----   |       |
        |   |   |   ----->    |
        |   |   |  ^  |   |   |
        |   |   |  |  |   |   |
        |   |   |  |  |   |   |
        |   |   |  |  |   |   |
        |   |   |  |  |   |   |
        |   V   |  |  |   |   |
        |    ----->   |   V   |
        +-------+     +-------+
.fi

This is not necessary in \fBhovacui\fP. The screen automatically starts showing
the top of the first column:

.nf
       +---------+
       |+-------+|    +-------+
       ||       ||    |       |
       ||       ||    |       |
       ||       ||    |       |
       +---------+    |       |
        |       |     |       |
        |       |     |       |
        |       |     |       |
        |       |     |       |
        |       |     |       |
        +-------+     +-------+
.fi

The cursor down key moves the screen down the text:

.nf
        +-------+     +-------+
        |       |     |       |
        |       |     |       |
       +---------+    |       |
       ||       ||    |       |
       ||       ||    |       |
       ||       ||    |       |
       ||       ||    |       |
       +---------+    |       |
        |       |     |       |
        +-------+     +-------+
.fi

This looks like moving down in the page like in a regular pdf viewer, but is
not. The difference shows when reaching the end of the column:

.nf
        +-------+     +-------+
        |       |     |       |
        |       |     |       |
        |       |     |       |
        |       |     |       |
        |       |     |       |
       +---------+    |       |
       ||       ||    |       |
       ||       ||    |       |
       ||       ||    |       |
       |+-------+|    +-------+
       +---------+
.fi

The next cursor down keystroke moves to the \fBnext part of text\fP, wherever
it is. In this case, a single keystroke moves to the top of the second column:

.nf
                     +---------+
        +-------+    |+-------+|
        |       |    ||       ||
        |       |    ||       ||
        |       |    ||       ||
        |       |    +---------+
        |       |     |       |
        |       |     |       |
        |       |     |       |
        |       |     |       |
        |       |     |       |
        +-------+     +-------+
.fi

The user needs not to move around in the page or even remember where the text
goes. A single cursor down keystroke is enough to continue reading, regardless
of whether the next part of the text is below, in the next column or in the
next page.

The cursor up key does the same in the opposite direction.

.
.
.
.SH MODE OF OPERATION

Before displaying a page, \fBhovacui\fP locates its blocks of text. It then
displays its first block with a blue border, zoomed enough to fill the width of
the screen. If the block is taller than the screen at this zoom, the cursor
down key scrolls it up. When the bottom of the block is visible, the next
cursor down keystroke makes the viewer switch to the next block.

This mode of operation is affected by various parameters, which can be
configured by keystrokes, from the menu (key \fI'm'\fP), via command line
options or the configuration file \fI$HOME/.config/hovacui/hovacui.conf\fP.

.SS View mode

Normally, \fBhovacui\fP splits the page into its blocks of text, and displays
them one at time.

Instead of the blocks of text, the area of the page that is displayed may be
the whole bounding box of the page (the smallest rectangle enclosing all text
in the page). This viewing mode is obtained by the keystroke \fI'v'\fP, by the
\fI'view mode'\fP entry in the menu, by the command line option \fI-v
boundingbox\fP and by the configuration file line \fImode boundingbox\fP.

It is equivalent to the page being a single block of text that is as large as
the bounding box. When \fBhovacui\fP fails to correctly locate the blocks of
text or their order, switching to this mode allows for a more conventional view
of the page. Still, the white border of the page is suppressed, making the text
larger than the "fit to width" mode.

The default is that \fBhovacui\fP chooses between these two reading modes (by
blocks of text and by the boundingbox) depending on whether the page looks
multiple-column or not. This is the mode \fIauto\fP. Reading by blocks of text
can be forced by the keystroke \fI'v'\fP, the \fI'view mode'\fP entry in the
menu, by the command line option \fI-v textarea\fP and by the configuration
file line \fImode textarea\fP.

Fitting the whole page to the width of the screen is another mode of operation,
obtained by the keystroke \fI'v'\fP, by the menu, by the command line option
\fI-v page\fP and by the configuration file line \fImode page\fP.

.SS Fit direction

Normally, \fBhovacui\fP fits the width of the text to the width of the screen.
This achieves the largest possible zoom not requiring the user to move right or
left for reading a single line of text.

If required, it fits the height instead: by the \fI'f'\fP key, the \fIfit
direction\fP entry in the menu, the \fI-f vertical\fP command line option and
the \fIfit vertical\fP line in the configuration file.

Zooming the text so that it is all in the screen is also possible: pressing
\fI'f'\fP again or using the \fIboth\fP fit direction. This allows for example
to view the whole text in the page at once, or the entire page, by also
selecting the boundingbox or page mode (previous section).

Also possible is the fitting direction "none", which allows arbitrary zooming
and moving in the page. This is mostly a hack to allow zooming more than
normally possible, and some things do not work (like moving to the next or
previous search match). With this fit direction, only PageUp and PageDown
switch page.

.SS Minimal width

Fitting the width of the text to the width of the screen produces the largest
possible zoom while keeping the lines of text wholly in the page. However, when
the block of text is very narrow, the resulting zoom may be too large.

For example, line numbers are usually separated from the text, and therefore
each makes its own block of text. A page number like "12" would be rendered so
large that its width is made the same of the screen, with the result that its
bottom being cut out of the screen.

The minimal width parameter prevents this from happening. It is the width of
the most narrow block of text that is fit to the width of the screen. Blocks of
text that are narrower than this are still zoomed, but only as if they were as
wide as the minimal width.

In short: the minimal width prevents narrow blocks of text to be zoomed too
much.

It can be set by the \fI'w'\fP keystroke, by the menu, by the \fI'-w'\fP
command line option and by the \fIminwidth\fP configuration file line. The
default is half the width of the screen minus the margin. It can be changed on
the fly with keys 'z' and 'Z'. They work like 'zoom in' and 'zoom out' keys,
but the block of text is never zoomed more than the width of the screen.

.SS The text distance

Locating the block of text depends on a parameter: the minimal distance between
blocks of text. If two letters are closer than this, they are considered to be
part of the same block of text. Therefore, two blocks of text are never closer
than this distance.

The default \fI15.0\fP is reasonable for most documents. On largely-spaced
pages the blocks of text may be too many, even one per paragraph. However,
since such pages are usually single-column, if the block of text are too many,
it is usually better to switch to bounding box mode (see above) rather than
increasing the text distance.

Nevertheless, the text distance can be changed by the \fI't'\fP keystroke, from
the menu, by the \fI-t\fP command line option and by the \fIdistance\fP
configuration file line.

.SS Block order

Once the blocks of text are detected, they are sorted so that viewing can be
switched correctly from one to the next. Three methods are available:
\fIquick\fP, \fItwostep\fP and \fIchar\fP.

The first two are based on sorting blocks vertically if they overlap
horizontally, otherwise they are ordered horizontally. This guarantees a
reasonable ordering on both single-column and multiple-column documents. The
\fIquick\fP algorithm is approximated, the \fItwostep\fP is exact but less
efficient.

The \fIchar \fP algorithm is based on the order of the characters of the blocks
in the page. The block that contains the first character is the first; the
block that contains the first character not in the first block is the second,
and so on.

The default is the \fItwostep\fP method, but can be changed by the \fI'o'\fP
keystroke, from the menu, by the \fI-o\fP command line option and the
\fIorder\fP configuration file line.

.
.
.
.SH KEYS

The cursor up and cursor down keys work as expected: they move up and down the
screen. However, when the bottom of the current block of text (bordered in
blue) is already visible, the cursor down key moves to the next block. The same
for the cursor up key.

The same applies to the cursor left and right keys. This implies that in
horizontal fit mode (the default), since the edges are always visible, the
cursor right key always moves to the next block of text and the cursor left key
to the previous. The converse happens in vertical fit mode.

The page up and page down keys move to the previous and next page. The home key
moves to the upper left corner of the first textbox in the page, the end key to
the lower right corner of the last.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE

All command line options can also be set in the configuration file
\fI$HOME/.config/hovacui/hovacui.conf\fP, but not the other way around.
Command line options take precedence over the configuration file. Most options
can also be changed at runtime via keys or the menu (keystroke \fI'm'\fP).

the size of the font of the user interface (the menus and the text fields);
this has nothing to do with the size of the text in the pdf document
.TP

.
.
.
.SH DOCUMENT RELOAD

Key 'r' and signal \fISIGHUP\fP make \fBhovacui\fP reload the current document.

The new version of the document may differ from the previous on its number of
pages and blocks of text in the current page. In such cases, \fBhovacui\fP may
need to move to a different page or block of text. For example, if it was
previously on page nine and the new version of the document has only eight
pages, it moves to page eight.

.
.
.
.SH ANNOTATIONS AND ACTIONS

Annotations and actions are not shown. When the current page contains some of
these, \fBhovacui\fP shows a label "contains annotations and actions" along
with the page number. This label is not shown if the only annotations and
actions in the page are internal links. The rationale is that the user is
warned about the presence of content that is now shown, so that it can be
retrieved with other programs, such as \fBpdfannot\fP.

.
.
.
.SH COMPARISON WITH GREEN(1)

\fBgreen\fP (http://github.com/schandinat/green) is a fine pdf viewer for the
Linux framebuffer and X11. It has some features more and some less than
\fBhovacui\fP:

.IP "  * " 4
green only allows fitting the whole page to the screen (horizontally,
vertically and both ways); hovacui also allows fitting a single block of text
at time or the bounding box of the page
.IP "  * "
green allows for arbitrary zooming and moving in the page;
by default, hovacui has automatic zooming and only allows vertical movements
(but horizontal movements are never necessary); it allows for arbitrary zooming
and moving in the page with viewmode=page and fit=none
.IP "  * "
green allows rotating the document; hovacui does not
.IP "  * "
green can display multiple documents (using tabs to switch to the next);
hovacui only shows a single document
.IP "  * "
green allows searching and moving to a given page, but does not have a user
interface; this means that the user has for example to type a page number
without seeing it; hovacui has a crude but functional user interface
.IP "  * "
hovacui has an inline help and allows for non-square pixels; green does not
(but a fork with these features exist: https://github/sgerwk/green)
.IP "  * "
hovacui briefly shows the page number when switching page; green does not
.IP "  * "
the configuration file of green allows for schemes (profiles); hovacui has a
configuration file but no schemes

.SH NOTES

If something goes wrong, press 'v' to change view mode.

The horizontal fit mode is intended for horizontal scripts, but \fBhovacui\fP
also allows for vertical fit mode. It however has no support for sorting blocks
of text for vertical scripts yet, nor for detecting multiple columns.

The cursor left and cursor right keys may not work as expected. Yet, they are
coherent with the general rule: when moving in a direction and the edge of the
current block of text in that direction is already shown, switch to the next
block of text. This means that in horizontal fit mode (the default) the left
and right cursor keys work as "move to the previous/next" block of text.
