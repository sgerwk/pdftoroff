.SH NAME
pdffit - fit pages into given paper size

.
.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpdffit\fP
[\fIoptions\fP]
\fIfile.pdf\fP

.
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION

Resize the pages of a pdf file to fit a given paper size. The page scaling
makes the text in the original page fill the output page but for the given
margin (default 40.0).

.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS

The options that are presumed to be most recurring in practice are \fI-p\fP
(paper size), \fI-o\fP (output file), \fI-l\fP (landscape output), \fI-m\fP
(margin), \fI-e\fP (fixed scale) and \fI-w\fP (whole page).

.TP
.B
-p \fIpaper\fP
paper size;
it can be a name (case insensitive)
like \fIa4\fP or \fIletter\fP,
or a pair of measures in points \fIwidth,height\fP;
the default is what in \fI/etc/papersize\fP;
if this file does not exists or it is not readable, the default is \fIa4\fP
.TP
.B
-o \fIoutfile\fP
the output file name;
default is \fIinput-paper.pdf\fP if the input is \fIinput.pdf\fP and the paper
size is \fIpaper\fP
.TP
.B
-l
landscape output
.TP
.B
-m \fImargin\fP
margin in the output file;
can be a single number or a quadruple \fIleft,top,right,bottom\fP;
the default is \fI0.0\fP if \fI-w\fP is also given, otherwise \fI40.0\fP
.TP
.B
-i
scale each page separately;
the default is to scale all pages the same
.TP
.B
-e
skip empty pages
.TP
.B
-w
resize the whole page, not just its text area;
this is the minimal change for modifying the paper size,
like turning a letter-size pdf into a4
.TP
.B
-r
do not maintain aspect ratio
.TP
.B
-k
adapt to ebook viewing: output page 200x250, default margin 5.0
.TP
.B
-g \fIx1,y1,x2,y2\fP
the destination page; by default is the same as the paper size
(see below for an explanation)
.TP
.B
-f
draw the border of the destination page
.TP
.B
-s
draw the border of the original page
.TP
.B
-d
draw a square in a corner to check margins;
this is intended for testing: it shows how large the margin is
.TP
.B
-b
draw the bounding box of each page;
this is intended for testing: it shows how large the page is considered to be

.SH DRAWINGS

This program copies only the text of the original page into
some part of the output page with the given margins.

To this extent, two boxes are defined in the original page: the page size (*)
and the bounding box, the latter being the box enclosing only the text in the
page.

Three boxes are defined in the output page:
the whole page (#),
the output destination page (%),
and the destination box (+).
The destination page is where the text with the new margins goes.
The destination box is the same without margins.

This program maps the bounding box of the input file into the destination box
of the output. In other words, it exactly fills the destination box with the
text in the input.

These boxes can be drawn on the destination page by options
\fI-f\fP, \fI-s\fP, \fI-d\fP and \fI-b\fP,
but of course the bounding box and the destination box should coincide.
.
.
.
.SH TODO
The bounding box only includes text; it should also include images.

The page could be clipped to its bounding box when copying it to the cairo
surface. This could only matters when only part of the page is actually copied,
not its entire bounding box.
