The **pdftoroff** program extracts text from pdf files, trying to undo page,
column and paragraph formatting while retaining italic and bold faces. It
ouputs text in various text formats: groff, html, plain TeX, text, or
user-defined format. It is used by the included **pdftoebook** script to
reformat a pdf file to a smaller page, so that it becomes suited to be read on
a small tablet or e-ink ebook reader.
