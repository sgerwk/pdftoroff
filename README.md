The **pdftoroff** program extracts text from pdf files, trying to undo page,
column and paragraph formatting while retaining italic and bold faces. It
ouputs text in various text formats: groff, html, plain TeX, text, or
user-defined format. It is used by the included **pdftoebook** script to
reformat a pdf file to a smaller page, so that it becomes suited to be read on
a small tablet or e-ink ebook reader.

Also included is **pdffit**, which resizes the pages of a pdf file so that
their text fits into a given paper size (e.g., A4 or letter) with a given
margin. The related program **pdfrects** finds the bounding box or the text
area of the pages of a pdf file.

The **hovacui** pdf viewer for the Linux framebuffer (fbdev) automatically
zooms to the blocks of text. It is aimed at viewing files on small screens, and
is especially handful for multiple-columns documents.
