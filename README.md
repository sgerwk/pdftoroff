pdftoroff extracts text from pdf files, trying to undo page, column and
paragraph formatting while retaining italic and bold faces. It ouputs text in
various text formats: roff, html, plain TeX, text, or user-defined format. It
can be used to reformat a pdf file to a smaller page, so that it becomes suited
to be read from a small tablet or e-ink reader.
